Holiday Sync
============

The Holiday Sync App for Project Online and on-premises allows you to import holiday calendar exceptions into 
your Project Server base calendars, a task which in the past needed to be done for each calendar at least once 
manually for all future dates.

Holiday Sync imports calendar holiday data from a free online web service available on the web at 
www.holidaywebservice.com.

This app was developed for Project Conference 2014 to showcase JavaScript, read more about it here:
